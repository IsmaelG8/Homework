I am excited to present a comprehensive project that I recently completed as part of my journey into the world of programming with Python. This project is encapsulated within a repository named 'python-challenge', designed to address two critical challenges: PyBank and PyPoll, each targeting distinct real-world applications through Python scripting.

Project Overview:

The 'python-challenge' project is structured into two main directories, each corresponding to a unique challenge. These are:

PyBank (Financial Analysis)
PyPoll (Vote-Counting Process)
Within each directory, a main.py script serves as the core of the analysis, executing tasks specific to each challenge's requirements.

PyBank Challenge:

The PyBank challenge focuses on analyzing financial records through a dataset named budget_data.csv, which includes two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. The primary objectives of this challenge include:

Calculating the total number of months included in the dataset.
Determining the total net amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
Computing the average change in "Profit/Losses" between months.
Identifying the greatest increase and decrease in profits, including the dates and amounts.
This financial analysis culminates in a detailed report, highlighting critical financial metrics, and is designed to both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

PyPoll Challenge:

The PyPoll challenge is aimed at modernizing the vote-counting process for a small, rural town. Utilizing a dataset named election_data.csv, with columns for Voter ID, County, and Candidate, the script developed for this challenge accomplishes the following:

Tallying the total number of votes cast.
Generating a complete list of candidates who received votes.
Calculating the percentage of votes and total number of votes each candidate won.
Determining the winner of the election based on the popular vote.
Similar to PyBank, this challenge's output includes a comprehensive election results analysis, which is both printed to the terminal and exported as a text file.

Conclusion:

This project not only demonstrates my ability to apply Python scripting to solve real-world problems but also highlights my proficiency in data analysis and report generation. Through the challenges of PyBank and PyPoll, I have showcased my capability to navigate complex datasets and deliver insightful, actionable analyses. I believe these skills are highly relevant and transferable to various programming and data analysis roles.
